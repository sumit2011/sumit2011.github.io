Introduction: Single linked list is a linear data structure. It is slightly different from array. It made by the nodes, each nodes consist a data and the address of the next node and each node are linked using pointers. Here data are not stored in the contiguous memory location, nodes are present anywhere in the memory space but every nodes are linked with eachother that’s why we call this linked list.

Main Components Docker Engine: The runtime that builds, runs, and manages containers (via the Docker CLI and API). Container: Containers are isolated processes for each of the app’s components. all the components like frontend react, backend python, postgres database run in the completely isolated environment.Containers are self-contained, isolated, independent and portable. Image: To share the container we need image. A Container image is a standerized package that includes all of the files, binaries and configuration to run the container. THere are two imp principle of images Images are immutable: once an image is created it cant be modifie. you can only make new image or add changes on top of it. Container images are composed of layers. Each layer represents a set of file system changes that add, remove, or modify files. Docker Hub Docker hub is the default global marketplace for storing and distributing images. it has more than 1 lac images created by the devs. we can dwnld and run the images. Registry: An image registry is a centralized location for storing and sharing the container images. It can be either public or private.(Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, private registries). Volume: Persistent storage mounted into containers.It is separate from a container’s lifecycle. It is used to store data so it doesn’t get lost when a container stops, restart or deleted. Network: Network means a virtual communication layer that allows containers to talk to each other and to the outside world. It connects containers securely. Dockerfile: A text file with instructions (FROM, COPY, RUN, CMD) used to build an image. Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container applications with a YAML file.

The constructor allocates memory for the stack using the new keyword, sets the stack size, and initializes top to -1 to indicate that the stack is initially empty. //array emplementation of stack #include\u003ciostream\u003e using namespace std; class stack { //properties public: int *arr; int top; int size; //behaviour stack(int size) { this -\u003e size = size; arr = new int[size]; top=-1; } }; ","date":"15-01-2023","objectID":"/stack/:2:0","tags":["C","C++"],"title":"Stack (array implementation)","uri":"/stack/"},{"categories":["DSA"],"content":"Push Function The push function is part of the stack class.
